Overview

This project develops an end-to-end data processing and analysis pipeline for an e-commerce company.
The goal is to clean, analyze, visualize, and automate reporting of sales, customer, and product data using Python.
It demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and automation, providing a strong foundation for data engineering and analytics projects.

Features
üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing product prices using cross-references from products.csv.

Corrected inconsistent or invalid date formats in sales.csv.

Detected and reported outliers in sales data (e.g., unusually high or low unit prices).

üìä Data Analysis

Summarized yearly, monthly, and daily sales trends.

Calculated total customer spending (total_spent).

Joined datasets to analyze sales distribution by product categories.

Identified top-selling products and customers.

Performed Pareto analysis (80/20 rule) to find customers generating most of the sales.

üìà Visualization

Line chart: Yearly sales trends.

Bar chart: Monthly sales summaries.

Pie chart: Category-wise sales distribution.

‚öôÔ∏è Automation

A Python script processes all .csv files in the folder automatically.

Cleans and merges data, performs analysis, and exports results to multi-sheet Excel files.

Fetches daily USD/TRY exchange rate via API and adds a converted sales column.
